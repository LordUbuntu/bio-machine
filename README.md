## Lessons Learned

- Keeping a design journal and starting with a clearer design plan would make it easier to keep track of the project.
- Keeping to a fixed scope of features that are very basic to start, and only adding more features after the base game is complete, worked out eally well.
- Keeping features and gameplay simple for the prototype helped to keep the base game feeling polished and easier to develop/test.
- Game balance can be a challenge and requires a lot of game testing.
- Avoiding premature optimizations (like object heirarchies and other complications) can save a lot of time and pain, especially for simple games where those design details are overkill.
